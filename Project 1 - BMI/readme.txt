What is BMI?

BMI is used as a screening tool to indicate whether a person is underweight, overweight, obese or a healthy weight for their height.

If a person's BMI is out of the healthy BMI range, their health risks may increase significantly.
BMI values are age-independent and the same for both sexes. However, BMI may not correspond to the same degree of fatness in different populations due to different body proportions.
